Features
--------
* Added ``USE_GRV_CACHE`` transaction option to allow read versions to be locally cached on the client side for latency optimizations. `(PR #5725) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/5725>`_ `(PR #6664) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/6664>`_

Status
------
* Added ``cluster.storage_wiggler`` field report storage wiggle stats `(PR #6219) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/6219>`_

Bindings
--------
* C: Added ``fdb_transaction_get_range_and_flat_map`` function to support running queries based on another query in one request. `(PR #5609) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/5609>`_
* Java: Added ``Transaction.getRangeAndFlatMap`` function to support running queries based on another query in one request. `(PR #5609) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/5609>`_

Other Changes
-------------
* OpenTracing support is now deprecated in favor of OpenTelemetry tracing, which will be enabled in a future release. `(PR #6478) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/6478/files>`_
* Changed ``memory`` option to limit resident memory instead of virtual memory. Added a new ``memory_vsize`` option if limiting virtual memory is desired. `(PR #6719) <https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/pull/6719>`_
